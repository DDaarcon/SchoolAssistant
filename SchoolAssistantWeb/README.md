### Why is React in here?
At the start, I intended to create UI with Razor pages, however, it turned out I will have to use some framework for complex pages, for example, schedule management. I decided to use React. As the project developed, I have been choosing to create more and more parts of the software with it.

Itâ€™s also my first project developed with the use of this framework. Throughout the project development, I have been learning everything almost from the basics, having only a little experience with React Native.
