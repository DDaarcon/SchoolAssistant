# SchoolAssistant
Base technologies: .NET 6, EntityFramework Core, SQL Server, React

### Description
The main purpose of this application is the management of school data, such as lessons, marks, and students. It allows you to arrange schedules, make changes in data, view past and incoming lessons, and conduct classes.

You can log in as Administrator, sample Teacher, or sample User. Credentials for these users are available in the preview mode menu, on the bottom left side of the screen. When logged in, this menu contains buttons that may be useful while viewing the project.

There are still a few things on my TODO list. Everything that needs to be improved is either listed [there](https://github.com/users/DDaarcon/projects/5) or with an appropriate TODO comment in the projectâ€™s files.
